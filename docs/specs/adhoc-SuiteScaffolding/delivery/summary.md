# adhoc-SuiteScaffolding — Summary

## Status: COMPLETE

## What Was Built
- Scaffolded the SprintRituals suite repo at `/d/src/sprint-rituals/` — a modular monolith Host with Identity service (auth, persons, users) and ported Fokus service (AppUser removed, Invitations kept). Includes BuildingBlocks, Jira/Xray modules, and frontend client.

## Key Outcomes
- 11 projects in SprintRituals.slnx, all building clean (0 errors)
- Identity service: Person/User domain, EF persistence with migrations, Google OAuth endpoints
- Fokus service ported as class library with shared Host composition
- Review: APPROVED after 3 cycles (3 HIGH findings fixed: invite token wiring, User/Role moved to Persistence removing vulnerable NuGet, IsActive migration default corrected)

## Deviations from Plan
- Developer created Identity CLAUDE.md manually (create-service skill requires it as prerequisite)
- User/Role entities moved from Identity.Domain to Identity.Persistence per architect decision (reviewer caught vulnerable NuGet dependency)
- Identity.API → Fokus.Persistence cross-reference added for invitation acceptance (architect decision)

## Notes
- The sprint-rituals repo is a fresh git init with no commits yet — all files are untracked
- Empty directories remain where auth files were removed from Fokus (harmless under no-.gitkeep policy)
- Lessons file contains 25 items (unprocessed) — available for future promotion
